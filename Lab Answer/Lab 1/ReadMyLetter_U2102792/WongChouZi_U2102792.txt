My name is Wong Chou Zi with matrix number, U2102792/1. I am 
majoring in Artificial Intelligence. This is my first time taking the 
Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling nervous about taking this 
subject. This is because I haven't learn about data structure before this. 
I acquired B+ for my previous Programming 1 course. It’s too bad. So, I 
think I must manage to get A or A+ for this DS subject this term. In order 
to do well in the subject, I will study harder and also do revision frequently. Wish me luck!!!

It's me again. Finally, it's the end of the term and the DS class has finished!
I think I did well in this course. I am quite glad and satisfied with my performance.
I have learnt lots of coding skills and knowledge which will help me to create a proper data structure.
During the course, I have paid 100% attention in the class. Besides that, I have completed all my homework in time.
What I can do next is find more material or reference book to improve my understanding about data structure.
